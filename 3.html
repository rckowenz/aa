        if im being honest, who gives a fuck about love?
        its pointless. eventually the person y oure in love with would leave.
        and once they do they wont think about you twice. especially
        if they have a new partner or in fact. never liked you in the first place.
        why did he have to nadd me lol. its not like he was in love with me at some point
        in fact he didnteven pay that much attentuion to me.
        i was in a relationship with myself pratically.
        im so stupid.

        i was talking to this one guy. once my phone broke, thats when we just became
        idk... we stopped speaking and he just stopped texting me one day, i guess
        the girl he used to b in love with came back, he unadded me and even unadded >me
        on roblox, thats how i know his toher girl came back.
        i shouldve known better and havent fell in love. boys are stupid.
        very sgtupid. i wish like, theres a decent man out there. once there is, they just fuck
        me over bc the girl they reallt wanted in the first place came back.
        usually they lie and say that "im not ready for a arealtionship"
        what the fuck dude. 
        sgtupid pointless shit. Love isnt fucking real.

        i would never fall in "love" again. its pointless.
        nor am i seeking a relationship anymore. like i said
        its pointless, no good ever comes for it at the end. they
        promise they wont leave and look what they do in the end. 
        only time i would date again is if its an irl relationship!
        maybe then i can see and telel if their love is genuine.
        evene then they can still cheat LOL. ill never get the title of being
        a fucking cuck. stupid bitch.
        my heart hurts and chest, fuck am i abt to die
        it huts nmo it hurts so bad ow bfuck. 
        what the fuck is love anyways LOL.
