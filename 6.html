        i have  no friemds, i usedd 2 have friends. my bsf.. 2-3 years, she finally stopped being my freind. 
        she found a new friend group ig uess? i dont know , it hurtts a lot i know that. i relly miss her,
        shes the only person i rlly enjoed tlaking to. on top of that i could tell her anything and she'll listen, now shes gone. she didnt
        reply the last time i etxted her so i just decided to unfriend her, it sucks a lot but, who knows, maybe its for the best. i have no friends now... the ones
        i apparently have barely speak to me. i try to make ne w friends but i easily ruin iy. i just find myself annoying after a while then i ditance myself. ill try to fix it
        i just, i think im anoying. i might be, at times. 
        i dont try to :( i cant help the way i am
        or i can. thats why im changing the way i am, im becoming  a different person.
        im making myself a new persona. i miss my bsf but its fine, ill forget abt her i hope.
        she was always favored than me, it sucks. i was never jealous tho, i just was sad because people never liked me 
        like they liked her, they always spoke shit about me behind my back, fuck these stupid losers. stupid fucking punks.
        my old bsf, lets call her.. idk i dont have a name, but lets just say... the friend.
        i miss her, she said i was just boy crazy and i forgot what else, i guess that got on her nerves.
        i didnt mean to be boy crazy but once i fall in love im deeply in  love, only reason why i told her any of that is becUSE 
        i thought she was my bsf, but ok whatever fuck you.
        pls i need friends i feel like a dumb fucking idiot loser it ss sad
