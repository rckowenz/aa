        sometimes i have thoughts of murdering someone. i should and
        know i should be worried about those types of thoughts,
        i wonder if i kill someone would i get away with it
        could i get away w murder? probably not
        i used to watch gore, god im so fucked up.
        it made me feel disgusted but at times i enjoed it
        i wanna kill someone, not a random person. in fact someone
        who deserves it. i wonder how you would even clean it up lol.
        i would probably tie someone up and leave their body ina  closet 
        and use them as a friend or use them as someone i speak to 
        when lonely. i used to wanna murder my family and skip town.
        im on pills now.
        i wonder if that wouldve worked <,,, sorry.
